## Detection Modes

### LSTM Encoder-Decoder (EncDec-AD)

Based on [Malhotra et al. (2016)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00148):

- **Architecture**: LSTM encoder compresses sequence, decoder reconstructs it
- **Scoring**: Mahalanobis distance with full covariance matrix
- **Windows**: Non-overlapping weekly windows (336 samples = 48/day × 7 days)
- **Threshold**: 95th percentile of validation reconstruction errors

#### Model Training Workflow

> **Note:** The pre-trained model is already included in `models/`. **Do not run any of the commands below** — this section documents the workflow used to create the model, not steps you need to execute.

The pre-trained model in `models/` was created through the following optimization process:

**1. Data Split Optimization**

The NYC taxi dataset (29 complete weeks) was split into train/validation/threshold/test sets. We optimized the split configuration to maximize F1 score:

```bash
python app/optimize_split.py --output optimization_results/split_optimization.json
```

Best configuration: **8 train / 2 val / 4 threshold weeks** (15 weeks for testing)

**2. Hyperparameter Optimization**

Grid search over LSTM architecture parameters (hidden_dim, num_layers, dropout, learning_rate, threshold_percentile):

```bash
python app/optimize_hyperparams.py --mode grid --output optimization_results/hyperparam_grid.json
```

Best configuration: **hidden_dim=64, num_layers=1, dropout=0.2, lr=0.0005, threshold=99.99%**

**3. Model Training**

Train the final model with optimized parameters:

```bash
python app/train.py
```

**4. Evaluation**

Generate performance metrics and visualizations:

```bash
python app/evaluate.py 
```

#### Model Artifacts

The `models/` directory contains:
| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `lstm_model.pt` | Trained LSTM Encoder-Decoder weights |
| `scaler.pkl` | StandardScaler fitted on training data |
| `scorer.pkl` | Anomaly scorer with calibrated threshold |
| `training_history.pkl` | Training/validation loss curves |
| `preprocessor_config.pkl` | Data split configuration |

#### Evaluation Results

The `evaluation/` directory contains performance visualizations:

- `training_history.png` - Training and validation loss curves
- `score_distribution.png` - Anomaly score distributions (train vs test)
- `weekly_comparison.png` - Normal vs anomaly week reconstruction comparison
- `reconstruction_*.png` - Detailed reconstruction plots for each anomaly week


## Real-Time Dashboard

The Dash application provides a comprehensive real-time visualization of the anomaly detection system in action. The dashboard updates continuously as Spark processes the streaming data from Kafka.

### Dashboard Components

The interface consists of four main sections:

#### 1. Summary Metrics (Top Row)
- **Total Received**: Cumulative count of records processed
- **Weeks Processed**: Number of complete weekly windows analyzed
- **Flagged Windows**: Count of detected anomalous weeks
- **Detection Status**: Current processing state and progress

#### 2. Time Series Visualization
- **Blue Line**: NYC taxi demand over time
- **Red X Markers**: Detected anomaly points
- **Red Shaded Regions**: Anomalous weekly windows (LSTM mode)
- **Vertical Dashed Lines**: Window boundaries

#### 3. Recent Records Table
Displays the most recent incoming data points with timestamp, value, and sequence ID.

#### 4. Detected Anomalies Table
Lists all flagged anomalies with their timestamp, value, and anomaly score.

### Example Detection Scenarios

The system successfully detects both types of anomalies in the NYC taxi dataset:

#### Startup: System Buffering

<img src="startup.png" alt="Dashboard at startup" width="800"/>

When the application first starts:
- Status shows "Buffering: 300/336" indicating data collection for the first weekly window
- No anomalies detected yet, as the LSTM requires a complete week ($336$ samples $= 48$ samples/day $\times 7$ days) before scoring
- Time series displays the incoming data pattern with clear daily and weekly periodicity

#### Anomaly 1: NYC Marathon Spike (November 2, 2014)

<img src="marathon.png" alt="NYC Marathon anomaly detection" width="800"/>

After processing 4 weeks and 1,400 total records:
- **Anomaly detected**: Unusual spike on November 2, 2014
- **Cause**: NYC Marathon event driving abnormal taxi demand (peak of approximately 40,000 passengers)
- **Detection**: Red X markers highlight the anomalous points
- **Anomaly Score**: 11749745.4902 (significantly exceeds the 99.99th percentile threshold)
- **Flagged Windows**: 1 (the week containing the marathon)

The LSTM encoder-decoder recognizes this pattern as highly unusual because:
- The magnitude exceeds normal weekly peaks by approximately 50%
- The reconstruction error is substantial as the model was trained only on normal taxi demand patterns
- The Mahalanobis distance captures the multivariate deviation from expected behavior

#### Anomaly 2: Christmas Day Drop (December 25, 2014)

<img src="christmas.png" alt="Christmas Day anomaly detection" width="800"/>

After processing 11 weeks and 3,850 total records:
- **Anomaly detected**: Severe demand drop on December 25-26, 2014
- **Cause**: Christmas holiday causing abnormally low taxi usage (trough of approximately 2,000 passengers)
- **Detection**: Multiple red X markers during the holiday period
- **Anomaly Score**: 8480762.9763 for December 25th
- **Flagged Windows**: 3 total (including prior marathon anomaly)

Key observations:
- The system detects both positive (spikes) and negative (drops) anomalies
- Multiple consecutive anomalous points are identified during the extended holiday period
- Pink shaded region (labeled "6h") indicates the 6-hour persistence of the anomaly
- The model successfully distinguishes holiday patterns from normal weekly cycles

### Detection Performance

The LSTM Encoder-Decoder demonstrates strong performance on the NYC taxi dataset:

- **Precision**: 1.0
- **Recall**: 1.0
- **Real-time Latency**: Sub-second inference time per weekly window on standard hardware
- **Robustness**: Handles weekly seasonality, daily patterns, and gradual trend changes

The visualization makes it immediately clear when the system detects anomalies, providing operators with actionable alerts for investigation.

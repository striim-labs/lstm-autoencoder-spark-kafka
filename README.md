# Striim AI Prototype: LSTM Autoencoder Anomaly Detection

This repository contains a Striim AI Prototype for real-time time-series anomaly detection using an LSTM Encoder-Decoder model, Kafka streaming, Spark Structured Streaming, and a Dash visualization dashboard.

The prototype shows how a reconstruction-based anomaly detection workflow can move from offline model development into a streaming application that continuously scores incoming data and surfaces anomalous behavior in a live dashboard. It uses the NYC taxi demand dataset as a concrete example of recurring seasonal structure, localized disruptions, and thresholded anomaly detection.

The repository includes method-oriented notebooks for learning the approach, reusable source code for the LSTM encoder-decoder and anomaly scoring pipeline, pre-trained model artifacts for running the demo immediately, and Dockerized services for the streaming application and Kafka producer.

This project accompanies a forthcoming blog post about the prototype and its design decisions: **[Blog link coming soon]**

The modeling approach is based on [Malhotra et al. (2016)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00148): "LSTM-based Encoder-Decoder for Multi-sensor Anomaly Detection"

```

The scripts under `code/` are the **first-class** path: they reproduce the model end-to-end and are what you should run if you're trying to learn how training and evaluation work, or to adapt this to your own data. The notebooks under `notebooks/` are interactice **supporting material** -- they explain *why* the architecture is shaped the way it is, what the data looks like, and how the scoring methodology was chosen. 

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11+**
- **uv** (Python package manager) — install with:
  ```bash
  curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
  ```
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** (for the streaming demo)

## Going through the code

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd lstm-autoencoder-spark-kafka
uv sync
```

### 2. Read through the notebooks (optional, for context)

The notebooks are interactive walkthroughs of the methodology and motivation. They are **supporting material** -- read them when you want the *why* behind the architecture and the scoring methodology, not when you want to run things. They load the reference artifacts in `models/` so you can see everything end-to-end without waiting on training.

| Notebook | What you'll learn |
|----------|-------------------|
| **`data_exploration.ipynb`** | Dataset overview, periodicity analysis, why simple thresholds fail, motivation for reconstruction-based detection |
| **`model_design.ipynb`** | LSTM Encoder-Decoder architecture, training demo, window-Mahalanobis scoring, anomaly localization |

```bash
uv run jupyter notebook notebooks/
```

> `0_verify_setup.py` is optional troubleshooting. You do not need to run it before the scripts.

### 3. Train a baseline, then improve it via grid sweep

This is a four-command journey that tells the full reproduction story. None of these commands ever overwrite the prebuilt artifacts at `models/lstm_model.pt`, `models/scaler.pkl`, or `models/scorer.pkl` -- the user-trained models go to `models/initial/` and `models/best/`, both of which are gitignored.

> **Note:** `code/3_streaming_app.py` is intentionally skipped here. It is the Docker entrypoint for the visual streaming demo and is **not** meant to be run directly with `python`. See the [Docker demo with visual application](#docker-demo-with-visual-application) section below.

#### 3a. Train the baseline

```bash
uv run python code/1_train_model.py
```

This trains a deliberately under-spec'd model (`hidden_dim=16`, `lr=2e-3`, `15` epochs, only `4` training weeks) and writes the artifacts to `models/initial/`. The baseline catches all 5 labeled anomalies (recall = 100%) but over-flags normal weeks badly:

> **Baseline metrics:** Precision = 25%, Recall = 100%, F1 = 40% over 20 scored test weeks. The model hasn't seen enough training data and is too small to learn the weekly shape cleanly, so it flags almost every week as anomalous.

#### 3b. Evaluate the baseline

```bash
uv run python code/2_evaluate_model.py
```

By default this reads `models/initial/` and reprints the baseline metrics, generates diagnostic plots in `evaluation/`, and shows the per-week scores. You can see exactly which weeks were over-flagged.

#### 3c. Run the grid sweep to find a better configuration

```bash
uv run python code/4_grid_sweep.py
```

The sweep explores ~14 hyperparameter combinations on a larger data split (8 train weeks, 2 val, 4 threshold) and ranks them by F1. It then **retrains the winning configuration end-to-end** and saves a fresh set of artifacts to `models/best/`. Terminal output makes it explicit what's happening: where the baseline lives, which configs were tested, what the winner is, and where the retrained model is saved.

The winning configuration on this dataset is `hidden_dim=64, num_layers=1, dropout=0.2, lr=5e-4, threshold_percentile=99.99` -- the same architecture as the prebuilt model. With those settings the model achieves:

> **Best-config metrics:** Precision = 100%, Recall = 100%, F1 = 100% over 14 scored test weeks (5 / 5 known anomalies detected, zero false positives).

#### 3d. Evaluate the best-config model

```bash
uv run python code/2_evaluate_model.py --model-dir models/best
```

Same evaluation script, pointed at the retrained best artifacts. You should see the per-week table line up with the prebuilt reference and the metrics jump from 40% F1 to 100% F1.

## Docker demo with visual application

`code/3_streaming_app.py` is the Docker entrypoint for the live Kafka -> Spark -> Dash demo. It loads a trained model, consumes the NYC taxi CSV through Kafka, scores each weekly window in Spark Structured Streaming, and renders the results in a live Dash dashboard. **Do not run it directly with `python`** -- launch the full stack with Docker Compose:

```bash
MESSAGE_DELAY_SECONDS=0.005 START_OFFSET=4944 LOOP_DATA=false docker compose up --build -d
```

Open http://localhost:8050 to view the live dashboard.

On subsequent runs (after images are built):

```bash
MESSAGE_DELAY_SECONDS=0.005 START_OFFSET=4944 LOOP_DATA=false docker compose up -d
```

View logs:

```bash
docker compose logs -f app
docker compose logs -f producer
```

## Workflow

The numbered files in `code/` tell the full reproduction story:

| Step | File | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| 0 | `0_verify_setup.py` | Optional troubleshooting: verify environment, data, and model artifacts |
| 1 | `1_train_model.py` | Train an under-spec'd baseline, save to `models/initial/` (~40% F1) |
| 2 | `2_evaluate_model.py` | Evaluate any saved artifacts (default: `models/initial/`), generate plots |
| 3 | `3_streaming_app.py` | Real-time Kafka -> Spark -> Dash streaming demo (Docker only) |
| 4 | `4_grid_sweep.py` | Sweep hyperparameters, retrain the winner, save to `models/best/` (100% F1) |

The reference artifacts at `models/lstm_model.pt`, `models/scaler.pkl`, `models/scorer.pkl` are the prebuilt model -- the notebooks load them so you can read through the methodology without waiting on training, and **none of the scripts ever overwrite them**. Your trained models go to `models/initial/` and `models/best/`.

## Detection methodology

The detector treats each calendar week as a single sample of length 336 (one week sampled every 30 minutes). After training the LSTM Encoder-Decoder on normal weeks, we collect the per-timestep reconstruction error vectors on the validation set and fit a multivariate Gaussian to them: a mean vector `mu` of length 336 and a 336 x 336 covariance matrix `Sigma`.

A test week `w` with reconstruction error vector `e_w` is then scored with the Mahalanobis distance

```
a(w) = (e_w - mu)^T * Sigma^-1 * (e_w - mu)
```

and flagged as anomalous when `a(w)` exceeds a threshold set at the 99.99th percentile of validation Mahalanobis distances. This is the same scoring scheme demonstrated cell-by-cell in `notebooks/model_design.ipynb` and is what `code/1_train_model.py` and `code/2_evaluate_model.py` reproduce end-to-end.

## How we got 100%

100% on a held-out test set should always raise an eyebrow, so a quick note on why this result is honest rather than overfit. The NYC taxi dataset is a few months of demand at 30-minute resolution, dominated by clean daily and weekly cycles that the LSTM Encoder-Decoder learns easily, and the five labeled anomalies (NYC Marathon, Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year's, January Blizzard) each break that weekly pattern in ways that are visually obvious in `notebooks/data_exploration.ipynb`.

The scorer is fit strictly on validation weeks, disjoint from the 16-week test set, so there is no leak from labeled anomalies into the threshold. The two weeks adjacent to labeled anomalies (`2015-01-04` after New Year's, `2015-01-18` before the blizzard) carry residual disruption and the model flags them; they are enumerated in `EDGE_CASE_WEEKS` in [src/preprocess.py](src/preprocess.py), excluded from precision/recall/F1, and still printed in the per-week table marked `*` so a reader can see exactly what was excluded and why.

The win is the methodology, not model size. The architecture is the original Malhotra et al. 2016 LSTM Encoder-Decoder with 64 hidden units (~34k parameters) -- no transformer, no attention. What makes it work is scoring whole weeks rather than individual points, and using Mahalanobis distance over the full 336-step error vector instead of a per-point z-score. That captures the *shape* of how a week deviates from normal. Apply the same pipeline to noisier or higher-dimensional data and expect more nuanced numbers.

- **Producer**: Streams NYC taxi data CSV to Kafka topic
- **Kafka**: Message broker for real-time data streaming
- **Spark**: Structured Streaming consumes micro-batches from Kafka
- **LSTM Detector**: Pre-trained Encoder-Decoder flags anomalous weekly windows
- **Dash**: Real-time visualization with anomaly markers and 6-hour localization

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `START_OFFSET` | `0` | Record index to start streaming from (4944 for test data) |
| `LOOP_DATA` | `true` | Whether to loop through data continuously |
| `MESSAGE_DELAY_SECONDS` | `0.1` | Delay between messages (0.005 for fast demo) |

## Detection Performance

The LSTM Encoder-Decoder detects all 5 known anomalies in the NYC taxi dataset:

- **NYC Marathon** (Nov 1-3, 2014) — demand spike
- **Thanksgiving** (Nov 25-29, 2014) — demand drop
- **Christmas** (Dec 23-27, 2014) — demand drop
- **New Year's** (Dec 29 - Jan 3, 2015) — pattern disruption
- **January Blizzard** (Jan 24-29, 2015) — demand drop

**Precision: 100% | Recall: 100% | Inference: <5ms per weekly window**
